# Smiley Poop Origins

Smiley Poop is a Tetris-like puzzle game where players stack and merge matching emojis‚Äîto create larger ones and score points. The goal is to build the create larger fruits and points without overfilling the screen. You can find further details on my [project page](/projects/Smiley-Poop/).

The game is my own implementation of the Suika game and the many free versions out there which use fruits instead of my emojis. The idea to code my own game came after I spent way too much time playing the Watermelon Game in the Christmas holidays of 2023. I found myself constantly frustrated by all the ads and in-app purchases so I decided to create my own version - one that keeps things simple and fun, without bombarding players with interruptions.

# How It All Came Together

It began over the 2023 Christmas holidays, when I started coding the core gameplay using Unity. The first version was built in just two weeks during my spare time. I was coding from scratch, using minimal premade assets apart from a few emoji animations. But that was only the beginning! From there, I developed the UI, scoring system, Google Play leaderboards, and game art, and built a tutorial, marketing materials, and website content ‚Äî all over the span of three months, working on it during evenings and weekends.

This project is a great example of the saying: ‚ÄúWe did it not because it was easy‚Ä¶ but because we thought it would be easy.‚Äù From my initial time estimate of 3-4 weeks of development, it was only finished around March!

Hope everyone has fun playing it!
