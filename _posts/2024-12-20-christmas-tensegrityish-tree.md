Merry Christmas with my custom-designed tensegrity tree! More details on how it works at the bottom of this page.

So how does it work? 

The weight of the pyramids above are balanced on the tip of the pyramid below via a fishing line spanning between the horizontal members (shown in pink below). The four wires at the four corners of the pyramid are for stability only (blue). Only 2 are engaged for any particular balance position.

The horizontal fishing lines (pink) are hand-tied with knots. The stability lines (blue) are adjusted and clamped with an M4 locking nut concealed within the golden node to allow for easier adjustability since some fine-tuning of thier length is required.
