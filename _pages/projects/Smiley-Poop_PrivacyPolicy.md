NickN built the Smiley Poop app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by NickN at no cost and is intended for use as is. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, 'my', 'me' refers to NickN, and 'you', 'your' refers to you, the user of the Services.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

Users may choose to log into their google account as described in the next section "Google Play Services" which can lead to the collection of data.

Users should also note that by installing the app through the Google Play Store, some performance tracking information is made available to me by the Play Store system (e.g. app performance, crashes etc...). This information is never transferred by me to any third parties for any reason.

Other than the aforementioned situations, Smiley Poop does not collect any information about users.

## Google Play Services

This app offers an online leaderboard provided by Google Play Services, if users sign in to their google account whilst playing the game. The privacy policy for using Google Play Services is linked below:
[Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

Users should be note that the privacy settings of Google Play Services can be changed through the Google Play app. The use of the online leaderboard is not required for the operation of the app and users can choose not to submit their scores within the game.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2024-07-19
